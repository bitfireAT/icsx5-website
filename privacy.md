App privacy policy
------------------

When you enter an iCalendar URL and optionally user name and password in
ICSx⁵, the user name and password will be sent to the specified server and
nowhere else.

User name and password for the calendars are stored in an app-private file.
However, calendar URLs are accessible for other apps. If there's sensitive data
in your calendar URLs (like access tokens), don't allow calendar
access to untrusted apps!

Event data are stored by the Android Calendar Provider and not by ICSx⁵
itself. ICSx⁵ won't send event data to anywhere.

**ICSx⁵ doesn't collect, process or transmit any statistical data like app or
server usage. There are no ads and there's no tracking.**


Web site privacy policy
-----------------------

This Web site ([ICSx⁵ Web site](https://icsx5.bitfire.at)) doesn't
collect or process personal data.

Visits are logged by the Web server. These logs are only used for maintenance
purposes and to generate anonymous access statistics.


Support privacy policy
----------------------

Support requests which are sent to our email addresses (`@bitfire.at`) may be stored
in our helpdesk system [Zammad](https://www.zammad.com/), which is located in Berlin,
Germany and our processor as set out in the GDPR. Collected personal data:

* name, email address, date/time
* support request (text and possible attachments, may include personal data)

These data will only be used to process the respective support request.

You have the right to access your personal data, let your personal data be
rectified or erased, restrict processing of your personal data, export your
