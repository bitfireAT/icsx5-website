We have decided to make ICSx⁵ free and open-source software
(FOSS) because we believe in the openness of the Internet and we want
to be a counterpart to all the big companies who want to force their
users to use proprietary standards.

iCalendar resources are more complex then they seem to be and
development was (and still is) very hard work. So, although we offer
ICSx⁵ for free, we highly appreciate your support and
ask that you either buy it (see [Download](/download/) page) or donate to the project.

**For donations, please use the channels listed on our [DAVx⁵ donation page](https://www.davx5.com/donate)
(just replace DAVx⁵ by ICSx⁵).**
