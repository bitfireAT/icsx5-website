ICSx⁵ is an Android app to subscribe to remote ("Webcal") or local
iCalendar files (like time tables of your school/university or
event files of your sports team). It will

* download each iCalendar file regularly at a given interval and
* import it into a native read-only calendar, which then can be used with your favorite calendar app.

**If you need two-way sync over CalDAV/CardDAV, use [DAVx⁵](https://www.davx5.com) instead.**
